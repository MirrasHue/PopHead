We're currently looking for people to our team to develop our game even faster.<br>
We need:
- [C++ programmers](#c-programmers)
- [Graphics designers](#graphics-designers)
- [Game designers](#game-designers)
- [Level designers](#level-designers)

In sections below there are expected skills and responsibilities for each of the 'job' type. Don't worry if you don't meet the requirements! You can always learn new skills in practice or just follow our work.

### C++ programmers
From programmers we expect at least some experience in C++ (for example public projects on GitHub). We use SFML, so it's nice to have some experience in that library, but it's not necessary. It would be nice if you know the newest standards of C++ (11/14/17) and rules of clean code. At the beginning we will give you some small tasks to check you out. Game is being written in C++17. We write unit tests in [Catch2](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2) framework.

### Graphics designers
Game graphics are in pixelart style. For creating graphics you can use any tool that you like. We don't require any previous experience in pixelart, or graphics at all, but we would like to see some examples of your work.

### Game designers
Creativity is the biggest advantage here. You would be responsible for writing game plot, UX and for basic maps planning. 

### Level designers
Our maps are being designed in tool called 'Tiled'. Since it's not popular, you don't have to have any experience with that. For recrutation we will require from you to create small map using our tileset, or to make some minor changes on current maps.
