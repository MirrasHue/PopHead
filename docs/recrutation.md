We're currently looking for people to help us with making PopHead.<br>
We need:
- [C++ programmers](#c-programmers)
- [Graphics designers](#graphics-designers)
- [Game designers](#game-designers)
- [Level designers](#level-designers)
- [Music creators](#music-creators)
- [Testers](#testers)

In sections below there are expected skills and responsibilities for each of the 'job' type. <br/> 
If you don't meet the requirements! Don't worry! You can always learn new skills and join us later.

### C++ programmers
From programmers we expect at least some experience in C++ (for example public projects on GitHub). We use SFML, so it's nice to have some experience in that library, but it's not necessary. It would be nice if you know the newest standards of C++ (11/14/17) and rules of clean code. At the beginning we will give you some small tasks to check you out. Game is being written in C++17. We write unit tests in [Catch2](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2) framework. If you don't know how to write unit tests don't worry. We don't use them all the time. Besides it's quite simple. If you want, we could give you some unit testing tasks in PopHead so you will gain experience in it.

### Graphics designers
Our game graphics style is pixelart. For creating graphics you can use any tool that you like. We don't require any previous experience in pixelart, or graphics at all, but we would like to see some examples of your work.

### Game designers
Creativity is the biggest advantage here. You would be responsible for making gameplay desigin decisions and maybe also writing game plot, UX and for basic maps planning. 

### Level designers
Our maps are being designed in 'Tiled'. You don't have to have any experience at making maps to join us. Just be creative! For recrutation we will require from you to create small map using our tileset. <br/>
Download Tiled from [here](https://thorbjorn.itch.io/tiled) <br/>

### Music creators
We expect at least basic skills at making music. <br/>
You can use every tool you want. <br/>
We mostly use ogg audio format in our game. <br/>
We would sometimes ask you to make some sounds (not only music). <br/>
You can send us music which you made in the past. <br/>

### Testers
We don't require any skills from testers.
We would tell you to test something which we just added to the game and we would tell you to play through the game before bigger release. You will also have affect of how game looks like giving some ideas to game and level designers.
Inside game we have special tool for testers which is internal terminal (command prompt).
You should check out the documentation on terminal [here](https://github.com/SPC-Some-Polish-Coders/PopHead/blob/master/docs/forLevelDesigners/terminalCommands.md)
